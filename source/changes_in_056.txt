-M_CW*Folder class was unloaded (at least on eCS 1.01) by the system even if still in use by some
 awake objects leading to WPS freeze on next access of a CW*Folder object. This was for example triggered
 by deleting a CD-Creator folder. The reason is not clear but some hopefully successful workarounds were added.
