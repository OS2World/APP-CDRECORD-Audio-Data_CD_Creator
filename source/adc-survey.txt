A./D.-Cd-Creator users: Request for help

Hi everyone,

This posting is directed to current users of the
Audio/Data-CD-Creator package for writing CD-R/RWs.

It's known that setting the right options for the various
helper programs may be a difficult process especially
for users new to CD writing. Main problem is probably
finding the right driver for Cdrdao/2.
To make things easier in the future I'm trying to create
a database containing the necessary information so
options may be set automatically when a writer is known.
For this I need your help. If your CD writer (or CD-ROM,
DVD writer) works with cdrecord and/or cdrdao/2 please
gather the information specified below and send it to
<adc-os2@cityweb.de>.
Note that this will help you and every OS/2 user in the
future so please take the few minutes.


Your privacy
------------
Well, it's sad that today one has to state the obvious
because of the ill-minded spammers out there, so here
it comes:

All the information you send in will only be used for
building the database and for nothing else. Your name
and email address will not be included in any document
or file and the sent in mail destroyed after processing.

Note that I will not answer to any of these mails so if
you have any questions/ideas/whatever use the contact
info contained in the Audio/Data-CD-Creator docs.
