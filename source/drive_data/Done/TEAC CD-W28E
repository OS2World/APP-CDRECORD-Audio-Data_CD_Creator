3. Does your writer support buffer underrun protection
   (burnproof/burnsave/just-link/...)?
   
  	 NO!!!!


4. Does your writer need the 'Sony multisession fix'? (Setting on the
General page 2)

	NO!!!


5. Additional needed options for cdrecord when writing audio CDs (if any).
	
	NOT USED

6. Additional needed options for cdrecord when writing data CDs (if any).
	 
	NOT USED
	
7. Writer or driver selection when using cdrdao. (cdrdao/2 page 1)

   Example: (driver) cdd2600, AOPEN CRW9624

   Your driver:  generic mmc


8. Additional options for cdrdao (if any). (cdrdao/2 page 1)


9. Are you using cdrdao.exe coming with CD-Creator? If no please
   specify the release you're using.
   YES, port CDRDAO release 1.1.8 doesn't work with ADC. However, to be honest I haven't tried any 
specific option yet.


10. If you use different settings for 1:1 copy (source) please specify
them
    here. Include everything you find on that page and the cdrdao release
    you're using. (cdrdao/2 page 2)
    
    I'am using DVD player with generic mmc as source
    

11. If you use different settings for 1:1 copy (target) please specify
them
    here. Include everything you find on that page and the cdrdao release
    you're using. (cdrdao/2 page 3)
    
    I'am using TEAC CDRW with generic mmc as target


12. If you use mpg123 or MMIOMP3 for MP3 decoding, do you have to specify
    'Swap bytes when writing'? (MP3 decoding page)
    
    YES, I do. Otherwise I get a lot of noise instead of music!


13. Send the information to

                 <adc-os2@cityweb.de>  (Note: remove the "DESPAM")
