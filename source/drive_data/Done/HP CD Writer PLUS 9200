3. Does your writer support buffer underrun protection

8. Additional options for cdrdao (if any). (cdrdao/2 page 1)
None

9. Are you using cdrdao.exe coming with CD-Creator? If no please
cdrdao2.exe

10. If you use different settings for 1:1 copy (source) please specify
them here.11. If you use different settings for 1:1 copy (target) please specify
them here.

I have been unsuccessful with the gui 1:1 copy, it hangs at the grap stage with 100% cpu, I 
have to kill 2 processes: cdrdao2.exe and something about drrexx

I am successful with 1:1 copying using a .CMD file like so:
@echo off
echo Put source in MATSHITA, blank in Yamaha...
pause
cdrdao2 copy --source-device 0,0,0 --source-driver generic-mmc --device 1,1,0 --driver 
generic-mmc --buffers 64 --eject --on-the-fly
rem
rem this cmd file is run from \bin
rem
echo ...
echo Done!
echo ...
echo Check for source file to delete:
dir cddata*.*

12. If you use mpg123 or MMIOMP3 for MP3 decoding, do you have to specify
    'Swap bytes when writing'? (MP3 decoding page)
I use Z!

There are 2 SCSI burners in this machine: HP 9200 & Yamaha CRW2200S. The Yamaha info 
was emailed a little while ago. There is also an IDE Panasonic CD reader in this machine that 
works for 1:1 copying as source 0,0,0, see CMD file above

Good luck and thank you for your efforts!!!
