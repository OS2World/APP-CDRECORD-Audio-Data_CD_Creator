3. Does your writer support buffer underrun protection
Yes, Yamaha SafeBurn System

4. Does your writer need the 'Sony multisession fix'?
No

5. Additional needed options for cdrecord when writing audio CDs (if any).
None

6. Additional needed options for cdrecord when writing data CDs (if any).
None

7. Writer or driver selection when using cdrdao. (cdrdao/2 page 1)

8. Additional options for cdrdao (if any). (cdrdao/2 page 1)
None

9. Are you using cdrdao.exe coming with CD-Creator? If no please
cdrdao2.exe

10. If you use different settings for 1:1 copy (source) please specify
them here.

11. If you use different settings for 1:1 copy (target) please specify
them here.

I have been unsuccessful with the gui 1:1 copy, it hangs at the grap stage with 100% cpu, I 
have to kill 2 processes: cdrdao2.exe and something about drrexx

I am successful with 1:1 copying using a .CMD file like so:
@echo off
echo Put source in MATSHITA, blank in Yamaha...
pause
cdrdao2 copy --source-device 0,0,0 --source-driver generic-mmc --device 1,1,0 --driver 
generic-mmc --buffers 64 --eject --on-the-fly
rem
rem this cmd file is run from \bin
rem
echo ...
echo Done!
echo ...
echo Check for source file to delete:
dir cddata*.*

12. If you use mpg123 or MMIOMP3 for MP3 decoding, do you have to specify
    'Swap bytes when writing'? (MP3 decoding page)
I use Z!

Good luck and thank you for your efforts!!!
