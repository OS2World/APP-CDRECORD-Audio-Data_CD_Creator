Dear Chris:

I am replying to your request for information on 
Audio/Data-CD-Creator. I use the complete package obtained from 
your website, with the exception of the Workplace Wizard.
Everything works well and I can successfully burn both audio and 
data CDs. The only problem I have found is that the audio CDs will 
not play on a CD player. They play prefectly well on a DVD player. 
Its an impressive and well-designed product - congratulations.

Gather the information
----------------------
The following bits of information are necessary. You may just insert 
it here when replying to this posting. If you have several working 
devices or a dedicated CD-ROM for
grabbing include the information for all of your devices by

to capture the information (be sure to adapt the dev=... setting) in a
