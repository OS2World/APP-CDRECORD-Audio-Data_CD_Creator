    temporary file.

    epm: D:\os2\apps\cdr2_0_0 >cdrecord dev=0,3,0 -prcap
    scsidev: '0,3,0'
    scsibus: 0 target: 3 lun: 0

    Device seems to be: Generic CD-ROM.


3.  Does your writer support buffer underrun protection
    (burnproof/burnsave/just-link/...)?

    No


4.  Does your writer need the 'Sony multisession fix'?
    (Setting on the General page 2)

    No


5.  Additional needed options for cdrecord when writing audio CDs
    (if any).


6.  Additional needed options for cdrecord when writing data CDs (if any).


7.  Writer or driver selection when using cdrdao. (cdrdao/2 page 1)

    (driver) plextor

    Note: --driver plextor-scan and -- driver generic-mmc work too,
          but grabbing and creating the toc is much slower.


8.  Additional options for cdrdao (if any). (cdrdao/2 page 1)

    None


9.  Are you using cdrdao.exe coming with CD-Creator? If no please
    specify the release you're using.

    CDBurn\ADC_053\bin\cdrdao.exe


10. If you use different settings for 1:1 copy (source) please specify
    them here. Include everything you find on that page and the cdrdao
    release you're using. (cdrdao/2 page 2)


11. If you use different settings for 1:1 copy (target) please specify
    them here. Include everything you find on that page and the cdrdao
    release you're using. (cdrdao/2 page 3)


12. If you use mpg123 or MMIOMP3 for MP3 decoding, do you have to specify
    'Swap bytes when writing'? (MP3 decoding page)

    Haven't created MP3 files yet.


Note: My current eCS 1.0 setup doesn't work with cdrdao. Even when I
use the same versions I'd used in W4 FP12, grabbing doesn't work -- or
I should better say: about 10--100 times slower.

The settings I post here have worked well with W4, but are quite slow
in eCS. (Hoping, that's nothing more than a IRQ problem of the Symbios
20810 driver -- BTW: I already tried to restore everything, e.g. the
driver versions, but I've another mainboard now.)
