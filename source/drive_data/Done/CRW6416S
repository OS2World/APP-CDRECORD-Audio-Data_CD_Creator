Hi, Chris.  This is a good idea.  Sorry that my information below isn't
complete -- I only burn data CDs here, although I've done a number of
variations using that (burning on the fly, burning from ISO image, and
creating El Torito bootable DOS discs using a bootable diskette image).

A noble and useful endeavor.  :-)

I might play with things this week and send you a more complete list of
settings (after testing to make sure they work, of course).

I don't think so.

>4. Does your writer need the 'Sony multisession fix'? (Setting on the
>General page 2)

No.  Then again, I don't burn multisession discs.

>5. Additional needed options for cdrecord when writing audio CDs (if any).

I don't write audio CDs on my PC, so I've not added any options.  (If
you're curious, I have a Philips CDR-765 CD burner on my stereo upstairs
that I tend to use for burning or cloning music CD-R's).

>6. Additional needed options for cdrecord when writing data CDs (if any).

None.

None.

I use the one bundled with CD-Creator 0.52.  Yes, I'm a version behind.

I've not set this up.

I've not set this up.

I don't use this.
